# Optimism Citizen Attestations

An attestation explorer for Optimism focusing on attestations that are relevant for the OP Citizens eligibility process.

## What Are Attestations?

Attestations are digital signatures on a structured piece of information. They play a critical role whenever you need to prove or verify something. EAS enables anyone to make attestations onchain or offchain about anything, fostering a more trustful and transparent world.

## What is EAS?

[Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.sh/) (EAS) is a public infrastructure for making attestations either onchain or offchain. It serves as a standard and base layer where any entity can make attestations about anything, providing a decentralized ledger for attestations.

## Why Trust Matters

In a world filled with both genuine and deceptive information, trust is crucial. EAS aims to provide a common way to trust the authenticity of information and the safety of interactions, both online and onchain.
